# CSCI-631-Computer-Vision
This folder contains projects done for Computer Vision course

01 - Take a photo from laptop camera and does a few basic transformations. This project also helps testing the server system.

02 - Runs a few operations:
	Laplacian pyramid for blending (apple orange and a personally chosen bridge superimpose)
	Denoising
	Numpy operations for various image transformations
	
03 - 	Separate mini-projects cover topics:
	Edge detection using Sobel
	Template Matching to get coins
	Testing correlation application for CV vs numpy speed check
	
04 - Line and Circle detection using Hough Transform

05 - fourier transform applications
	Magnitude and Phase view of images
	Hybrid images using low pass and high pass of images
	Convolution Theorem outcome
