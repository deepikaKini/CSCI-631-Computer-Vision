Steps:
- Download zip - “doodle_flow.zip”
- Open the front-end folder in IDE(preferably vs code) and run the command “npm install”. Later, use “npm start” and you see that localhost:3000 opened on the browser.
- Open the back-end folder in IDE (pycharm) and check the readme.md document. Install the packages mentioned here. Run sender.py using the command “python3 sender.py”.
- Now, open the browser link and select a doodle model. Once you select a model you want to draw doodles on, click on the button. It will start your webcam. Now, use a red pen/rubix cube to draw the shape you want.
Keep in mind that the webcam automatically stops after 10 seconds. Then go to the browser and double-click on the back canvas. This will draw the points and generate 5-6 doodles and simultaneously save these as images in the downloads folder.
